      <h3>What is a full-stack developer?</h3>
      <p>
        When the word full-stack developer comes to mind, one employer always
        expects a person who has mastery over comprehensive technical solutions.
        In simple terms, a full-stack developer is a professional who
        understands and masters the front-end (client-side), back-end
        (server-side), and databases of the web application.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in order to clearly understand what a full stack developer is,
        you need to be well-versed with the elements of web development i.e. the
        user interface (front-end) and the server-side (back-end).
      </p>
      <p>
        A website or web application’s functionality depends on two main
        elements known as the front-end and the backend.
      </p>
      <h3>What is Front-End Development?</h3>
      <p>
        Front-end development, also known as client-side development is the
        element of the website that a user can see or interact with. This
        element gives one’s website or application visual functionality. For
        example, if you plan on making a website for your business some photos
        and content will not make up your website. You will need to give them
        selection criteria, a track for the client’s info, your location,
        contact details, etc. Front-end development is what makes these
        functions appear to the user on the application.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Back-End Development?</h3>
      <p>
        Backend Development, also known as server-side development is the
        element that is not visible to the clients. The core functionality of a
        back-end development lies in the fact of making the interaction of the
        user with the application smooth and hassle-free. In addition to this,
        it is responsible for maintaining and organizing databases and
        behind-the-scenes functionality of the front-end as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Full-Stack Developer Skills</h3>
      <p>
        A full-stack developer as aforementioned is not a multifaceted role. To
        excel at this role one requisite, not just a formal degree instead,
        extensive knowledge of a variety of skills. Diversity is the key to
        excellence and success in the profession of a full-stack developer.
